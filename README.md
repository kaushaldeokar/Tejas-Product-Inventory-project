# Tejas Inventory Managemnt
--------------------------------------
The Tejas Product Inventory Management System is designed to streamline and optimize the management of Tejas Networks' extensive inventory of network products. This system leverages modern technologies to address the complexities of inventory management, providing a robust, scalable, and efficient solution. The backend is developed using both Java Spring Boot and Node.js individually, allowing for comparative advantages in security, performance, and scalability. The frontend is built using React.js, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience, while MySQL is employed for reliable and efficient database management. By integrating these technologies, the system offers real-time inventory tracking, reporting capabilities. This approach enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves decision-making processes, ultimately supporting Tejas Networks' goal of maintaining optimal inventory levels and superior customer service.â€‹

# Backend SpringBoot


## Initializer

Minimal [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/) sample app.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 22]
- [Maven Build Tool]
- [MySql Server]

## Create Database in Local System 

   $ create database tejas_app;

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `src/main/java/BackendApplication.java` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3
  

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`!  After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

###
### Yarn installation
  After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.
